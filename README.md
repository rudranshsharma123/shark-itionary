## Inspiration
I wanted to build a platform that would help people with the knowledge of sharks. I for once, have barely any idea about sharks. Hence, I began with the only place I could think of. That being various shark species. So, my primary objective was to create an app that would help people see what type of shark it is and to see what that kind of shark looks like by simply searching for it.
## What it does
It uses Jina-AI's search to produce all the results. There are two ways of querying, namely the text-based wherein you search for a shark's images by typing in the species. The second one being, where you upload the image of the shark and you would see what species that shark is.

## How I built it
I built the frontend using Electron JS and backend using Flask and Jina 

## Challenges I ran into
This was my first time using mainstream frontend i.e HTML, CSS, and JS so using them in conjunction with python seemed a bit of trouble. Using and setting up Jina was a bit of a challenge.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
The fact that it works and it was my first time makes me very proud. 

## What I learned
I learned about Jina, JS, HTML, CSS, Electron, etc.
